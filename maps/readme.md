# Character count exercise

This is a little exercise we did at the recent GoLang Meetup.

Read from proverbs.txt and display the character count:

```
Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
'.': 1, 'c': 4, 'n': 5, ''': 1, 'e': 4, 'y': 4, 's': 2, 'r': 4, 'g': 2, 'o': 5, ',': 1, ' ': 8, 'u': 2, 'a': 4, 'b': 2, 'D': 1, 'm': 8, 'i': 4, 'h': 2, 't': 3,
```
